16.	

a.	Calculate the total sales against each order ID and use conditional formatting to highlight values greater than the total averages sales

b.	For the tops 5 order IDs, create a table that lists down the category wise sales using index match (structure shown below):

OrderIDs	- Category1 - Category2 - Category3 - Total
________________________________________________________
123		
________________________________________________________
456	
________________________________________________________
789		
________________________________________________________
012		
________________________________________________________
345		
________________________________________________________
678		
________________________________________________________
Total				
________________________________________________________
17.	How many orders fall within specific sales ranges (e.g., <$100, $100-$200, $200-$300, $300-$400, $400-$500, $500-$600, $600-$700, $700-$800, $800-$900, >$1,000)?
(Use COUNTIFS to define multiple ranges.)
