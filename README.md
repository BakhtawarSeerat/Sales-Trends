a.	Calculate the total sales against each order ID and use conditional formatting to highlight values greater than the total averages sales
b.	For the tops 5 order IDs, create a table that lists down the category wise sales using index match (structure shown below):

Order IDs	Category 1	Category 2	Category 3	Total
123				
456				
789				
012				
345				
678
